A widget that helps to display guild raid progress.

== Description ==

A widget that helps to display guild raid progress.
Each boss have separate option to toggle kill, heroic kill and mythic kill. Each raid can be toggled to be displayed or not and if it should be shown or collapsed by default.

There is theme support with sample Light and Dark theme. Also my own theme is attached if you are interested. You should create your own theme and customise it to match your needs.

Progress can be configured in widget menu.
Theme and backgrounds toggle is in Settings > WoW Progress menu.

If you managed to find bugs or want to correct some of my code, please don't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me on martinek@freevision.sk.

For list of raids, check latest change log. I usually add raids as people report new patch coming up on the support forums.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In Appearance > Widget simply drag widget to sidebar.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= How do I change the look of plugin? =

You can create new plugin theme by creating new <theme>.css file in `/wp-content/themes/<your_theme>/wowprogress/themes/` folder. Then select this theme from Settings > WoW Progress.

= How do I change background images of raids? =

You can either replace image of raid in `plugins/wow-progress/images/raids/` folder, or you can upload your own and change filename in raids.json.

= I can't see new raids? =

You can enable which raids are shown in widget in Settings > WoW Progress. If you can't see your raid there, it probably isn't supported or plugin wasn't updated yet. Please let me know if any new raids are missing.

= Can I use this for other games? =

As of 1.7.0 you can! Create your own `raids.json` and put it in `/wp-content/themes/<your_theme>/wowprogress/` folder. Add your custom raid and expansion images to `/wp-content/themes/<your_theme>/wowprogress/images/` (expansions to `exp` folder, raids to `raids`). This should do it. Don't forget to activate your raids both in settings and in widget.
I have created package for FFXIV. If you are interested, let me know via email.
